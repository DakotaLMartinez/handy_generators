Description:
    This generator will add a helper and a partial for displaying edit and delete links 
    for a record. This uses pundit by default to check whether a user should be able to 
    edit and/or delete the record before displaying the link. If you'd like to always 
    display these links when you use the helper in the view or handle the logic yourself, simply add --pundit false to your command.

Example:
    rails generate edit_links_helper add [--pundit false]

    This will create:
        app/helpers/edit_delete_links_helper.rb
        app/views/shared/_edit_delete_links.html.erb
